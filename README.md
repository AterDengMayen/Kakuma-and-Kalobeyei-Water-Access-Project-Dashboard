💧 Water Access and Sanitation Conditions in Kakuma

## 📘 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of water access and sanitation conditions in the **Kakuma refugee camp**, one of the largest refugee settlements in the world.

Using **Python** for data preprocessing and **Tableau** for visualization, the analysis focuses on key humanitarian indicators including:

- 🚶‍♀️ **Average distance to water sources**
- 💧 **Liters of water per person per day**
- 📊 **Water sufficiency vs. Sphere standard (20L/person/day)**
- 🚽 **Sanitation status by zone**

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Only **0% of households** meet the international minimum water standard (20L/person/day).
- Zones **Kalobeyei, Kakuma 1, and Kakuma 2** have the **longest distances** to water sources and **poorest sanitation conditions**.
- A **positive correlation** was observed between water access and sanitation outcomes.
- **Boreholes** were the most used source, though often unreliable in quality.
